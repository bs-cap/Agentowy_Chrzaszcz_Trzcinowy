    Role: Inventory Verification Agent

    Primary Responsibility:
    The stock_checker agent is responsible for validating product availability within the system's inventory database. 
    Upon receiving a queryâ€”typically from the recipe_advertiser or supply_adviser agents it performs a lookup to determine whether a specific product exists and is in stock. 
    It then returns a structured response indicating the product's availability status.

    Key Functions:

    Query the product database using product identifiers or names.
    Return a binary or detailed availability status (e.g., in stock, out of stock, low stock).
    Ensure fast and reliable communication with requesting agents.
    Optionally, provide metadata such as quantity available or restock ETA if applicable.
    Inter-Agent Communication:

    Receives requests from: recipe_advertiser, supply_adviser
    Sends responses to: Requesting agent with product availability data
    Example Use Case:
    When the recipe_advertiser agent needs to confirm if all ingredients for a recipe are available before publishing it, 
    it sends a list of required items to the stock_checker, which verifies each item and returns the results.
